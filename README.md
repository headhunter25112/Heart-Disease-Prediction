# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Preditction of Heart Disease in a person based on several environmental and health factors 


Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a major cause of mortality worldwide. Traditional clinical risk assessments focus on physiological factors but often overlook lifestyle influences. This project aims to develop a predictive model for CVD risk using behavioral and lifestyle factors from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset.

The dataset consists of 308,854 entries with 25 variables, including general health, medical checkups, exercise habits, diet, BMI, smoking history, and more. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) has revealed key correlations between lifestyle factors and heart disease, highlighting the importance of early lifestyle interventions. Additionally, this project seeks to assess the probability of a person getting cardiovascular disease based on various environmental and lifestyle factors using different machine learning models.
